 │ —— Reading this resume with context ——————————— │
 │                                                 │
 │ I like to cut through noise and get straight to │
 │ the point. I've attempted to design this resume │
 │ to be as concise and clear as possible, while   │
 │ also allowing me to take liberties in ways a    │
 │ traditional resume might not. I also really     │
 │ like plain text.                                │
 │                                                 │
