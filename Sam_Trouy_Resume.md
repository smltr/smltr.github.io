## **What I Bring**

* **Commercial & Product Ownership:** I don't just write code, I align technical implementation with business goals. I understand how features impact revenue, retention, and user satisfaction.  
* **Technical Translation:** I bridge the gap between engineering and non-technical stakeholders. I can explain complex architectures to customers and translate business pain points into technical specifications.  
* **High agency:** I operate with high autonomy. Whether it's closing a technical gap for a sale or shipping a critical fix, I figure it out without hand-holding.  
* **Systems thinking:**I connect dots across the entire stack—from the physical layer (Wire Tech experience) to the cloud infrastructure (AWS/Go). I see the whole picture.  
* **Rapid Prototyping:** I build to demonstrate value. I excel at spinning up proofs-of-concept and demos that validate assumptions and help close deals or clarify requirements.
